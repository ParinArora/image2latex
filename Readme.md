# Text2LaTeX

A deep learning project that converts mathematical equations from images to LaTeX code using a combination of image encoding and transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. 

## Project Structure
- `image_to_latex.py`: Main inference script for converting images to LaTeX
- `train_image_encoder.py` & `train_image_encoder_rms.py`: Training scripts for the image encoder component
- `train_latex_vae.py`: Training script for the LaTeX VAE model
- `AutoEncoder_Latex.py`: Core model architecture definitions
- `latex_to_latex.py`: Utility for LaTeX processing
- `inspect_loss.py`: Tool for analyzing training losses
- `models`: Directory with model weights for encoder-decoder
= `project_report`: contains pdf containing the project report
